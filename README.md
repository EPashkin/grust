Grust is an implementation of
[GObject introspection](http://live.gnome.org/GObjectIntrospection)
bindings for the [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

The goal of this project is to provide a Rust binding generator that creates
safe Rust bindings from GIR files, as well as generated binding crates
for the core GLib, GObject and GIO APIs.
